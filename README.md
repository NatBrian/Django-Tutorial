##Step 1: Install Python/Pip and Requirements

Django is a web framework that works with Python. If you don't already have python, install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Now, we are going to go ahead and install Django, and VirtualEnv. To do this, simply enter the repository:
```
cd \path\to\Django-Tutorial
```
and checkout the file 'requirements.txt', you'll see:
```
Django==1.9.2
virtualenv==1.11.4
```
Now let's install pip. Simply run
```
sudo python get-pip.py
```
Now you've installed pip!

Then, execute: 
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
You will install Django version 1.9.2 and virtulenv 1.11.4

##Step 2: Boom, Workshop Done!
Try this: 
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Now, head over to 'localhost:8000' [in your favorite browser (Chrome, of course)](https://gfycat.com/IllustriousPowerfulIlsamochadegu)
